On walking. (9/11/2014)
I was walking home through all the drunk people the other night and encountered a particularly obnoxious clump of four people all standing next to each other spread out across the entire sidewalk.  I brushed past them and continued walking on when I heard someone say in a loud, sarcastic voice, <i>"walking with purpose."</i>  I gave a thumbs up, said "YUP" loudly and continued walking.  The person then shouted "are you a <i>freshman</i> in <i>forbes</i>?" (it was meant to be a condescending, and all the better cause I happen to live in Spelman, which is probably the hottest place to live at Princeton.) So, still walking, I turned my head back said with satisfaction "I am a <i>senior</i> in <i>spelman</i>".  That shut them up, and the timing was perfect cause I had reached the door to my building.  

It was really a stupid and small event, but it stood out. Cause <i>no one</i> gets away with judging me for the speed of my walking. A small (but certainly significant) part of why I like to walk so much is to be seen.  When I'm walking by myself I like to <i>take command</i> of the sidewalk.  Almost everyone has certain situations where they have swag and certain situations where they don't.  I tend towards the nerdy and awkward side of things a lot of the time, but I know that when I get in the zone with walking I can <i>take control</i> of the sidewalk with <i>confidence, collection, and cool,</i> and I'm vain about it.  Although walking fast doesn't make me a better, smarter, or more interesting person than anyone else, it somehow manages to give me the confidence I need to keep clawing out the my little corner of this crazy place.
