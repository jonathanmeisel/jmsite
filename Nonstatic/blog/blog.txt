On Walking

No one gets away with judging me for the speed of my walking. A small (but certainly significant) part of why I like to walk so much is to be seen.  When I'm walking by myself I like to take command of the sidewalk.  Almost everyone has certain situations where they have swag and certain situations where they don't.  I tend towards the nerdy and awkward side of things a lot of the time, but I know that when I get in the zone with walking I can take control of the sidewalk with <it>confidence</it>, <it>collection</it>, and <it>cool</it>, and I'm vain about it.  Although walking fast doesn't make me a better, smarter, or more interesting person than anyone else, it somehow manages to give me the confidence I need to keep clawing out the my little corner of this crazy place.
